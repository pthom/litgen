    """ Vectorizable functions example
        Numeric functions (i.e. function accepting and returning only numeric params or py::array), can be vectorized
        i.e. they will accept numpy arrays as an input.

     Auto-vectorization is enabled via the following options:
         options.fn_namespace_vectorize__regex: str = r"^MathFunctions$"
         options.fn_vectorize__regex = r".*"
